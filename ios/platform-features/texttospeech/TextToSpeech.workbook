# Text to Speech on iOS

Have you ever wanted to add text to speech capability in an iOS application? Speech synthesis is built into the platform. What’s more, adding speech synthesis only requires a few lines of code.

The class that synthesizes text to speech is the `AVSpeechSynthesizer`.  This class works with an `AVSpeechUtterance `instance that encapsulates the text to synthesize. You simply pass an `AVSpeechUtterance `instance to the synthesizer’s `SpeakUtterance `method and the text is “spoken” by the iOS device.

The following example is all you need to have text to speech:

```csharp
using AVFoundation;

var synth = new AVSpeechSynthesizer();
var su0 = new AVSpeechUtterance("Would you like to play a game?");
synth.SpeakUtterance(su0);
```

The `AVSpeechUtterance `also includes several properties that allow you to control the audio output of the synthesized text. These include:

* `Rate `– The speed at which the speech plays back. This appears to be device specific!

* `Voice `– An AVSpeechSynthesisVoice instance used to speak the text.

* `Volume `– The volume level of the audio used to speak the text.

* `PitchMultiplier `– A value between 0.5 and 2.0 to control the pitch of the spoken text.

In particular, the default rate is somewhat fast on modern iOS devices. Adjusting the rate to 1/4 the maximum rate, available via the `AVSpeechUtterance.MaximumSpeechRate` property (there’s also an `AVSpeechUtterance.MinimumSpeechRate`) produces a better sounding result. 

Here is some code you can play with to explore the available properties:

```csharp
var su1 = new AVSpeechUtterance("This sentence is being spoken in a customized manner.") {
    Rate = AVSpeechUtterance.MaximumSpeechRate / 2 ,
    Voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.FromLanguage ("en-AU"),
    Volume = 0.5f,
    PitchMultiplier = 0.7f
};
synth.SpeakUtterance(su1);
```

It’s possible to use voices from locales with non-English default languages. The words are translated, but the sentence is not translated grammatically:

```csharp
AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.GetSpeechVoices().Skip(7).Take(5).Where( voice => {
    var su2 = new AVSpeechUtterance("These words will be spoken in the language for the locale, but the sentence is not really translated.");
    su2.Voice = voice;
    synth.SpeakUtterance(su2);
    return true;
});
```
