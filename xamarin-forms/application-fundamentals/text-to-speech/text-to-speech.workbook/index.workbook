# Translating Text to Speech

Each platform provides a native text to speech API that can be invoked from Xamarin.Forms.

## Initializing the Workbook

In order to run a Xamarin.Forms workbook, some initialization code must be executed:

```csharp
// The Xamarin.Forms initialization code isn't important to understanding this workbook
#load "FormsInit-iOS.csx"
using Xamarin.Forms;
using AVFoundation;
```

For more information about the initialization code, see the Getting Started with Xamarin.Forms workbook.

## Adding a Platform-Specific Speech Method

Each platform uses a different speech API. The following code, which uses the `AVFoundation` APIs, can be used to translate text to speech on iOS:

```csharp
float volume = 0.5f;
float pitch = 1.0f;

public void Speak(string text)
{
  if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(text))
  {
    var speechSynthesizer = new AVSpeechSynthesizer();
    var speechUtterance = new AVSpeechUtterance(text)
    {
      Rate = AVSpeechUtterance.MaximumSpeechRate / 3,
      Voice = AVSpeechSynthesisVoice.FromLanguage("en-US"),
      Volume = volume,
      PitchMultiplier = pitch
    };
    speechSynthesizer.SpeakUtterance(speechUtterance);
  }
}
```

The `SpeechSynthesizer` class synthesizes the text to speech, with the `AVSpeechUtterance` class encapsulating how the text will be spoken. The following `AVSpeechUtterance` properties are set to control the spoken text:

* `Rate` ‚Äì the speed at which text is spoken.

* `Voice` ‚Äì an `AVSpeechSynthesisVoice` instance used to speak the text.

* `Volume` ‚Äì the volume level of the voice used to speak the text.

* `PitchMultiplier` ‚Äì a value between 0.5 and 2.0 to control the speech text.

###### Note

In a Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio Xamarin.Forms solution, the `Speak` method should reside in the iOS platform project, and be invoked from the Xamarin.Forms project using the `DependencyService` class. For more information, see [Implementing Text-to-Speech](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/dependency-service/text-to-speech/).

## Invoking the Platform-Specific Speech Method

The `Speak` method can be invoked from Xamarin.Forms to translate text to speech:

```csharp
var entry = new Entry
{
  Placeholder = "Enter text to speak here"
};
var button = new Button
{
  Text = "Speak"
};
button.Clicked += (sender, e) =>
{
  Speak(entry.Text);
};
stackLayout.Children.Add(entry);
stackLayout.Children.Add(button);
```

When the `Button` is clicked, the platform-specific `Speak` method translates the value of the `entry.Text` property to speech.

## üëç Try it now!

* Increase the speech volume and pitch.

* Increase the speech speed.

* Change the speech oice.
