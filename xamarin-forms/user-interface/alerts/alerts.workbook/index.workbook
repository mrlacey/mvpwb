# Displaying Pop-ups

Xamarin.Forms provides two pop-up like user interface elements: an alert and an action sheet. An alert is a modal pop-up to alert the user, or to ask simple question of them. An action sheet is a modal pop-up that' used to guide the user through a task.

In order to run a Xamarin.Forms workbook, some initialization code must be executed:

```csharp
// The Xamarin.Forms initialization code isn't important to understanding this workbook
#load "FormsInit-iOS.csx"
using Xamarin.Forms;
```

For more information about the initialization code, see the Getting Started with Xamarin.Forms workbook.

## Displaying an Alert

An alert is displayed with the `DisplayAlert` method on any `Page`:

```csharp
await page.DisplayAlert("Alert", "You have been alerted.", "OK");
```

The alert displays modally and once dismissed you can continue interacting with the application.

---

###### Note

The `DisplayAlert` method is asynchronous, and should be preceded by the `await` keyword.

---

An alert can also be used to capture a user's response by presenting two buttons:

```csharp
bool answer = await page.DisplayAlert("Question", "Would you like to play a game?", "Yes", "No");
```

The response to the alert is returned as a `boolean` value.

## Displaying an Action Sheet

An action sheet is displayed with the `DisplayActionSheet` method on any `Page`:

```csharp
string result = await page.DisplayActionSheet("Send to?", "Cancel", null, "Email", "Twitter", "Facebook");
```

The response to the action sheet is returned as a `string` value.

---

###### Note

The `DisplayActionSheet` method is asynchronous, and should be preceded by the `await` keyword.

---

The third argument to the `DisplayActionSheet` method is known as the *destruct* button, and can be `null` or given a value:

```csharp
string result = await page.DisplayActionSheet("Save Photo to?", "Cancel", "Delete", "Photo Roll", "Email");
```

Notice that the *destruct* button is rendered differently from the other action sheet buttons.

---

###### Note

The fourth argument to the `DisplayActionSheet` method is of type `params string[]`. Therefore, an action sheet can display any number of responses for the user to select from.

## üëç Try it now!

* Create an alert that contains a cancel button.

* Create an action sheet that contains days of the week as responses.
