# Entering Text

The Xamarin.Forms `Entry` view is used for single-line text input, and can also be used as a password field.

In order to run a Xamarin.Forms workbook, some initialization code must be executed:

```csharp
// The Xamarin.Forms initialization code isn't important to understanding this workbook
#load "FormsInit-iOS.csx"
using Xamarin.Forms;
```

For more information about the initialization code, see the Getting Started with Xamarin.Forms workbook.

## Setting and Reading Text

An `Entry`, like other text-presenting views, exposes the `Text` property, which is used to set and read the text presented by the `Entry`:

```csharp
var entry = new Entry {
    Text = "Click here to see the virtual keyboard"
};
stackLayout.Children.Add(entry);
```

To read text, access the `Text` property:

```csharp
var text = entry.Text;
```

---

###### ‚ö† Warning

The width of an `Entry` is defined by settings its `WidthRequest` property. Do not depend on the width of an `Entry` being defined based on the value of its `Text` property.

---

## Changing the Virtual Keyboard

A virtual keyboard appears when an `Entry` has focus. The `Entry` defines a `Keyboard` property that allows you to specify the virtual keyboard that's displayed:

```csharp
entry.Keyboard = Keyboard.Numeric;
```

Click in the `entry` instance and the numeric keyboard will appear.

The `Keyboard` property is of type `Keyboard`, which defines the following readonly-only properties:

* `Default`

* `Text`

* `Chat`

* `Url`

* `Email`

* `Telephone`

* `Numeric`

For more information about changing the virtual keyboard, see [Choose a keyboard for an Entry](https://developer.xamarin.com/recipes/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/controls/choose-keyboard-for-entry/).

## Showing Placeholder Text

An `Entry` can show placeholder text when it's not storing user input. Placeholder text is often shown to clarify the content that's appropriate for an `Entry`:

```csharp
var passwordEntry = new Entry
{
  Placeholder = "Enter password"
};
stackLayout.Children.Add(passwordEntry);
```

## Inputting a Password

An `Entry` has an `IsPassword` property. When this property is set to `true`, the contents of the `Text` property will be masked:

```csharp
passwordEntry.IsPassword = true;
```

Click in the `passwordEntry` instance and enter some text. You will notice that the text is masked.

## Setting Colors

The colors of an `Entry` can be changed by setting the `TextColor` and `BackgroundColor` properties:

```csharp
entry.TextColor = Color.White;
entry.BackgroundColor = Color.Blue;
```

---

###### Note

Placeholder text color can't be customized and will be the same regardless of the the `TextColor` setting.

---

## Interacting with an Entry

An `Entry` exposes `Completed` and `TextChanged` events:

* The `Completed` event is raised when the user has ended input by pressing the return key on the keyboard.

* The `TextChanged` event is raised when the text changes in the `Entry`, and provides the text values before and after the change.

```csharp
var eventsEntry = new Entry { Placeholder = "Enter text to observe events firing" };
var completedLabel = new Label();
var oldTextLabel = new Label();
var newTextLabel = new Label();

eventsEntry.Completed += (sender, e) => { completedLabel.Text = "Completed event has fired"; };
eventsEntry.TextChanged += (sender, e) =>
{
  oldTextLabel.Text = e.OldTextValue;
  newTextLabel.Text = e.NewTextValue;
};

stackLayout.Children.Add(eventsEntry);
stackLayout.Children.Add(oldTextLabel);
stackLayout.Children.Add(newTextLabel);
stackLayout.Children.Add(completedLabel);
```

Enter data in the `eventsEntry` instance, and watch the `Label` instances update as the value of the `eventsEntry.Text` property changes.

## üëç Try it now!

* Change the `entry` instance to use the `Url` keyboard.

* Change the `entry` instance to use a gray background, with black text.
